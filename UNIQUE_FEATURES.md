# 🚀 Zen Snap - 10 Features You Won't Find on Snapchat

We aren't just cloning usage patterns; we are building the next evolution of social interaction.

## 1. 🔮 Proximity-Based AR Memories
**Leave a mark on the world.** Drop public or private "Time Capsules" at specific GPS coordinates.
*   **Snapchat:** Only has location-based stories (heatmap).
*   **Zenith:** Persistent AR objects. You can leave a 3D note floating in a coffee shop for your friend to find when they visit.

## 2. 🎮 Interactive AR Multiplayer Lobbies
**Turn the world into a game board.**
*   **Snapchat:** Has mini-games (Snappables).
*   **Zenith:** Persistent AR "Lobbies". Turn a park into a "King of the Hill" zone where you physically have to be there to capture the territory.

## 3. 🧠 Smart Contextual Feeds (AI-Powered)
**See what matters, when it matters.**
*   **Snapchat:** Algorithmic feed based on engagement.
*   **Zenith:** Context-aware sorting. If you are at a concert, the "Stories" tab prioritizes content from *that* concert and friends nearby, filtering out irrelevant noise.

## 4. 🕶️ "incognito" IRL Mode (Spatial Privacy)
**Control your digital footprint.**
*   **Snapchat:** Ghost Mode hides your location entirely.
*   **Zenith:** "Selective Visibility". You can appear on the map *only* to friends within 50 meters, while remaining invisible to everyone else. Perfect for meetups without broadcasting your home location.

## 5. 🎨 Collaborative Canvas Walls
**Graffiti the world together, legally.**
*   **Snapchat:** No world-scale drawing collaboration.
*   **Zenith:** Shared AR Walls. A designated wall in a city can be a collaborative canvas where everyone can draw on it via AR, creating a massive community mural.

## 6. 🔊 Spatial Audio Voice Notes
**Hear the world in 3D.**
*   **Snapchat:** Flat audio messages.
*   **Zenith:** Pin a voice note to a location. When you walk closer to the pinned note in AR, the volume gets louder. It feels like the person is whispering in your ear *right there*.

## 7. 🛍️ Real-Time AR Commerce Try-On Marketplace
**Shop the street.**
*   **Snapchat:** Brand filters (ads).
*   **Zenith:** Peer-to-Peer AR Marketplace. Sell your old bike by placing a 3D scan of it on the sidewalk. Passersby can inspect it in AR and buy it instantly.

## 8. 🛡️ "Anti-Screenshot" Quantum Encryption
**True ephemerality.**
*   **Snapchat:** Notifies on screenshot.
*   **Zenith:** "Visual Noise" Technology. Content is displayed with a high-frequency flicker (imperceptible to eye, but confuses cameras) or requires "Active Touch" (holding 3 corners) making physical screenshots nearly impossible.

## 9. 🌡️ Mood-Based UI Adaptation
**An app that feels how you feel.**
*   **Snapchat:** Static yellow theme.
*   **Zenith:** Biometric/AI sentiment analysis. If you're typing fast and angry, the UI calms down (blue tones). If you're excited (exclamation marks!), the particles ramp up.

## 10. 🌐 "Zenith Portal" (Desktop/VR Bridge)
**Cross-reality connection.**
*   **Snapchat:** Primarily mobile.
*   **Zenith:** A web/VR client that lets PC users "visit" locations via the cameras of mobile users (with permission). Be a "virtual tourist" in Tokyo through a local's lens.
